# Simple Example

A lazy man's front-end

**this is an example project**

dependencies :

`go get github.com/romainmenke/simple-mini`

`go get github.com/romainmenke/simple-bundle`

`go get github.com/romainmenke/simple-gzip`

`go get github.com/romainmenke/simple-template`

`modd`

`go-bindata`

---

modd is your watcher, simple-... provides minifying, bundling, templating and gzipping

you get a node free stack

you get to be the awesome go developer that you are. (We all love to reinvent static file servers...)

---

Is this for you? no, this was an accidental creation, usage is not advised.
